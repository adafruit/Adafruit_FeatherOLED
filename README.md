# Adafruit_FeatherOLED Library [![Build Status](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_FeatherOLED/workflows/Arduino%20Library%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_FeatherOLED/actions)[![Documentation](https://github.com/adafruit/ci-arduino/blob/master/assets/doxygen_badge.svg)](http://adafruit.github.io/Adafruit_FeatherOLED/html/index.html)

This is the helper class to work with 128x32 and 128x64 OLED displays on Adafruit Feathers.

Tested and works great with the following Adafruit OLED FeatherWings:
* http://www.adafruit.com/products/2900 (128x32)
* https://www.adafruit.com/product/4650 (128x64)

This chip uses I2C to communicate, 2 pins are required to interface.
